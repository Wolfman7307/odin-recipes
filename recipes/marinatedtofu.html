    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As I’ve shared before, I live near Portland, Oregon. I’m about 30 minutes from the city, 
        and honestly, with my kids and everything else going on, I don’t get to enjoy the bounty 
        of vegan restaurants quite as often as I’d like. Several months ago, we ate at a place 
        called the Bye and Bye, and they had the most delicious tofu. I got a BBQ tofu, brussels 
        sprouts and rice bowl, and it was A-mazing. The tofu had flavor like I had never tasted! 
        Flavor was infused all throughout each piece of tofu, and I decided I needed to find a way 
        to re-create this deliciousness at home.</p>

    <p>After several tries, I have finally perfected this flavorful marinated tofu. If you think 
        tofu is bland, boring, or difficult to make, think again! I’ll teach you how to make the 
        best tofu ever. I love serving this with rice and some stir fried vegetables, but it’s 
        also good in sandwiches, on salads or simply as a high protein snack.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Ounces Extra-Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons Low Sodium Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Pure Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Fresh Grated Ginger or 1/2 Teaspoon Dried Ginger</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Canola Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Quick press the tofu: Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface 
            such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a 
            layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a 
            large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes while you make the 
            marinade. </li>
        <li>Make the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, 
            sesame oil, garlic and ginger. </li> 
        <li>Marinate the tofu: Place the pressed tofu pieces in a shallow dish. (In the photos 
            above I doubled the recipe, so I used a 9 x 13 inch dish, but for one batch you will 
            need a smaller dish, such as an 8 x 8 inch.) Pour the marinade over the tofu. Let it 
            marinate for at least 1 hour, covered, in the refrigerator. If you want to leave it 
            overnight, it will be even more flavorful.</li> 
        <li>Cook the tofu: In a large skillet, cast iron preferred, add a few tablespoons of a 
            neutral oil, such as canola oil and heat over medium-high heat. You can omit the oil 
            if needed, but you will need a very good non-stick pan so the tofu pieces don't stick. 
            Remove the tofu pieces from the marinade and add to the pan. Do not discard the marinade 
            sauce. Fry the tofu until golden brown on each side.</li>
        <li>Once the tofu pieces are browned, pour any leftover marinade sauce into the pan with the 
            tofu, and stir to coat. This makes the tofu even more flavorful! The tofu will quickly 
            absorb the sauce. Remove from heat, and serve with rice and stir fried vegetables such 
            as baby bok choy, mushrooms and carrots.</li>
        <li>Store leftover tofu in a covered container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. It's also 
            good cold, as a high protein snack or in sandwiches and salads.</li>          
    </ol>
